🎓 ## **Student Feedback & Satisfaction Analysis**

Data Science & Analytics Internship Project – Future Interns

📌 **Project Overview**

Student feedback plays a crucial role in improving the quality of academic courses, teaching methodologies, and overall learning experience.
This project focuses on analyzing student satisfaction survey data to identify strengths, gaps, and improvement opportunities across courses and departments using data analytics techniques.

🎯 **Objectives**

Analyze student satisfaction ratings (1–5 scale)

Identify high-performing and low-performing feedback areas

Compare satisfaction levels across different courses and programs

Visualize feedback trends to support academic decision-making

🗂️ **Dataset Description**

Source: Student Satisfaction Survey (CSV)

Records: 580 feedback entries

Key Attributes:

Feedback questions

Rating weightages (1–5 scale)

Course name

Basic course category

🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**

Google Colab

Python

pandas – data cleaning and manipulation

🔍 **Methodology**

Imported and cleaned student feedback survey data

Created a weighted satisfaction score using rating distributions

Conducted:

Question-wise satisfaction analysis

Course-wise comparison

Rating distribution analysis

Visualized key trends and patterns

Provided actionable recommendations for academic improvement

📊 **Key Insights**

Majority of students rated their academic experience between 4 and 5, indicating overall satisfaction

Certain feedback questions consistently scored lower, highlighting specific areas for improvement

Student satisfaction varies across different courses and programs

Strong participation in feedback submission across departments

✅ **Recommendations**

Focus improvement initiatives on low-scoring feedback parameters

Adopt best practices from high-performing courses across departments

Conduct targeted follow-up feedback surveys for underperforming areas

Continuously monitor student satisfaction using data dashboards


🚀 **Outcome**

This project demonstrates how student feedback data can be transformed into meaningful insights using Python-based data analytics, enabling institutions to enhance academic quality and student satisfaction.
